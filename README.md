# Zero-Hunger
ITPM Project initial commit
SDG – Zero Hunger


Problem – There are many needy people in this world with essential needs of foods.  When food and commodity 
prices skyrocketed, equity became apparent, sparking limits on food export and worries about societal unrest. 
The most disadvantaged people must always have access to wholesome, culturally appropriate food, therefore 
we must address the ingrained disparities that threaten just food systems.


Solution- This is a system which Donators can Donate foods. It is the operation of the “Udonate”. 
It will receive a wide range of foods, money donations and donate for different needy peoples at different countries and areas. 
We helped many peoples and will help to many needy peoples across the world.
